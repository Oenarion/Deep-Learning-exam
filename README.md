# Deep-Learning-exam

This was a project I was asked to do for the Deep Learning exam during my master in AI, what I had to do was to predict the next frame of a series of 3 images taken from the "moving_mnist" dataset.<br>
The purpose of this repository is to help other people that may have problems in this kind of tasks.<br>
Note that this got me a 27/30 mark, the best model to implement was SimVP which is the state of art as of now.

<br>
The repository has two files:<ul>
<li> "moving_mnist.ipynb" is the file given by our professor.</li>
<li> The other one is the file I delivered for examination.</li>
</ul>
